.Synopsis
	Test unit for the Stepper.
	Author: Roman Kuzmin

.Description
	It is a step unit example. Steps are macros and script blocks returned by
	this script. This script should not be invoked directly. Either use the
	cmdlet Invoke-FarStepper or call the test Test-Stepper-.ps1.

	A step unit contains two parts: standard code and script blocks. A unit is
	invoked as a normal script, it may or may not do some job itself (Part 1).
	Normally it returns steps (Part 2). It is fine to return nothing.

	Steps may add extra steps by $Psf.Stepper.Go(). Extra steps are inserted
	into the queue after the current. This is useful when all steps are not
	known beforehand, e.g. actual steps may depend on a user choice.

	Steps are invoked in different scopes and local variables of one step are
	not available for another. In order to share data between steps use global
	variables or, even better, the automatic variable $Data (shortcut for
	$Psf.Stepper.Data).

	The script also shows how to enter modal UI and continue steps in it.

### Part 1. Optional code to be invoked before steps.
# - Good place to check prerequisites and throw on errors.
# - It is also fine to return with no steps returned at all.

# check prerequisites and throw on errors
Assert-Far ($Far.Window.Count -eq 2) "Close Far Manager internal windows before this test." "Assert"

### Part 2. Returned steps: returned keys and script blocks.
