Features

 * Smart history of files and folders
 * Ready for typing incremental filter
 * For other features see history lists help (F1)

The history logs are updated on openings from the smart history lists.

The smart history lists show items in heuristically improved order. Recently
used items are sorted by last times, as usual. Items not used for a while are
sorted by ranks. Ranks are based on last time, frequency, activity, and factors
calculated by training.

How training works. For every item record it builds several ranked lists with
different factors. The list with the item nearest to the top wins. Finally the
factors that maximize the total difference between the plain and ranked lists
for all records are taken.

Background history training and update starts periodically after selecting
items from smart lists. Thus, manual trainings and updates and not necessary.

History log files:

- *%FARLOCALPROFILE%\FarNet\Vessel\VesselHistory.txt*
- *%FARLOCALPROFILE%\FarNet\Vessel\VesselFolders.txt*
