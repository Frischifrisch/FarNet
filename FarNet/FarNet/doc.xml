      Gets the panel directory or sets a new directory and opens its native file panel.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      If it is a directory tree panel then the path is the currently selected directory in the tree.
      If it is a module panel then it normally returns <see cref="FarNet.Explorer.Location"/>
      or the value assigned to the <see cref="Panel.CurrentLocation"/>.
      <para>
        It throws on setting if a directory path is not valid or does not exist.

      It is not yet clear that it is needed. User feedback is welcome.
    </para>
  </Experimental>
  <EditorList>
    <para>
      This list is only for iterations, access by indexes, and removal by
      indexes. Accessed lines allow changes but new strings should not
      contain line separators. Other editor changes during using this
      list may cause unexpected results and should be avoided.
    </para>
  </EditorList>
  <RegisterModule>
    <para>
      If you plan to unregister this action then keep the returned reference and call its <see cref="IModuleAction.Unregister"/> later.
      Instead of keeping the reference you can get it by its ID by the <see cref="IFar"/>.<c>GetModule*()</c> methods.
    </para>
  </RegisterModule>
  <ActionGuid>
    <para>
      Use <c>System.Runtime.InteropServices.GuidAttribute</c> for the action ID.
      The ID must be unique and it should never change.
      It is used for storing data and interoperability.
    </para>
  </ActionGuid>

    </summary>
  </UseLastHistory>
  <WrapCursor>
    <summary>
      Tells to use the wrap cursor mode.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      In the wrap cursor mode moving the cursor up from the first element or down from the last element
      moves the cursor to the bottom or the top. In menus the default is true, as recommended by the API.
    </remarks>
  </WrapCursor>
  <AutoAssignHotkeys>

  <ButtonClicked>
    <summary>
      Called on the button clicks and similar actions: [Enter] when focused or the hotkey at any time.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      NOTE: even if this is the default control (<see cref="IDialog.Default"/>) or
      the cancel button (<see cref="IDialog.Cancel"/>) the event is not triggered
      if the button is not explicitly clicked or a similar action is performed.
      Thus, [CtrlEnter] (accept the dialog) and [Esc] (cancel the dialog)
      do not trigger this event.
    </remarks>
  </ButtonClicked>
  <ShowAmpersand>
    <summary>
      Tells to show ampersand symbols in the text instead of using them as hotkey marks.
    </summary>
  </ShowAmpersand>
  <CenterGroup>
    <summary>
      Tells that the control if one of the centered group.
    </summary>
    <remarks>

      Their horizontal coordinates are ignored.

  </CenterGroup>
  <NoFocus>
    <summary>
      Tells that the control cannot get focus. But it still processes other events.
    </summary>
  </NoFocus>
  <HelpTopic>

    <remarks>
      This method is used in special cases when <see cref="ShowHelpTopic"/> is not enough.
      <para>
        The <c>topic</c> parameter describes a help topic and can be in one of the following formats:
      </para>
      <code>
        <![CDATA[
"Topic"
Reference to a topic in the help file.

":Topic"
Reference to a topic from the main Far Manager help file.

"<FullPath\>Topic"
Reference to a topic in a help file located in a folder with full or relative
path of FullPath. An ending backslash must be added. The reference must not be
split on multiple lines. For example, the help file is located in the folder
"D:\Far\FarNet\Modules\Foo" and we need the topic "FooInfo" from it:
"<D:\Far\FarNet\Modules\Foo\>FooInfo"

"<FullModuleName>Topic"
Reference to a topic in a help file located in the same folder as the module
with the relative or full path of FullModuleName. The reference must not be
split on mutiple lines. For example, we need the help topic "FooInfo" from the
help file of the module Foo "D:\Far\FarNet\Modules\Foo\Foo.dll":
"<D:\Far\FarNet\Modules\Foo\Foo.dll>FooInfo"
]]>
      </code>
    </remarks>
  </ShowHelp>
  <Colors>
    <param name="foregroundColor">Foreground color.</param>
    <param name="backgroundColor">Background color.</param>
  </Colors>
  <Include>
    <summary>
      Creates and shows <see cref="IInputBox"/>.
      Note: <see cref="IInputBox.EmptyEnabled"/> is set to true.
      If you need more input box options, use the interface directly.
    </summary>
  </Include>
  <FileMask>
    <summary>
      File(s) mask, see Far API help topic [File masks]; format "include|exclude" is also supported.
      This value is only the default suggestion, actual mask may be changed by a user.
    </summary>
  </FileMask>
  <BaseListItems>
    <summary>
      List item collection. STOP: see remarks.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      Normally you fill the list with items and set their properties before opening a
      dialog. After opening this collection is mapped to a control dynamically, i.e.
      all operations (set, insert, remove and etc.) are displayed immediately. The
      items themselves are not mapped dynamically, so that if you change an item then
      you have to reset it explicitly, see the example.
      <para>
        Dynamic mapping is simple, useful and effective when you change (or add, remove)
        one item at a time (or just a few items). But if you actually recreate all the
        items then for better performance you have to use <see cref="DetachItems"/>
        before changes and <see cref="AttachItems"/> after changes.
      </para>
    </remarks>
    <example>
      (PowerShell): how to set an item checked when the dialog is running
      <code>
        <![CDATA[
# get an item
$item = $listbox.Items[3]
# change it
$item.Checked = $true
# set it!
$listbox.Items[3] = $item
]]>
      </code>
    </example>
  </BaseListItems>
